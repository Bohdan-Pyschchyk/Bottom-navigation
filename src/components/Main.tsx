            Yolo Group story
          </h1>
          <p className="main__text">
            Yolo Group was established in 2014, primarily as a B2B platform provider. One of our first brands was Bitcasino.io, which is the world&#39;s first licensed bitcoin casino to offer an experience comparable to the world&#39;s leading fiat online casinos and is built upon Yolo Group&#39;s proprietary gaming platform.
          </p>
          <p className="main__text">
            After quickly establishing itself as the number one choice for bitcoin gaming, we launched a standalone sportsbook, Sportsbet.io, in 2016 ahead of that summer&#39;s European Championships.
